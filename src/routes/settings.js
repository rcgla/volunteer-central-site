/* 
site-wide settings are:

activity types
event types
locations and rooms per location
roles
track types
tshirt sizes
user group types (e.g. 'band', 'crew', etc )

TODO: should this be managed on one page or many separate pages? 
the former may be more streamlined; the latter easier to conceptualize and implement.
